# Answers

1. While Client-side routing is handled entirely by the browser, server-side routing is handled by the server. In client-side routing, the request does not hit the server and the browser returns the response, while in server-side routing, every request hits the browser and the server is solely responsible for returning s response.
   

2. HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is a rule that defines how pieces of information are exchanged between two machines located at different ends.
